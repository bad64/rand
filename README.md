# Rand

I have a couple of MCQs this week, and had some spare time. Apparently too much of it, because somehow I decided to waste them by coming up with this.

You may or may not use it for its intended purpose, that being answering MCQs in your stead, when you draw a complete blank. But don't hold me responsible 
if you fail :-)

(Also *please* don't use it on the entire exam.)

**USAGE**

rand <option 1> <option 2>... <option n>
